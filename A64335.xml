            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He being eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with order has formed the intellectual part of the ſublunary world, like the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> into three Stories, Oeconomicall, Politicall, Eccleſiaſticall. The tuition of them he has committed to men, and expects from them a prudent care to prevent a departure from the deſign and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51243:4"/>import of their primitive Inſtitution. If they ſhall neglect an inſpection into thoſe irregularities, which menace divine order with diſſolution; it is the uſuall method of Heaven to appoint a Day of Viſitation, and to manifeſt diſpleaſure againſt the Community by ſome ſignall calamity. The connivance of Governours makes the exorbitances of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons the ſins of the Community; and though the puniſhment of particular men may be deferred to a future ſtate: yet Communities having no reſurrection in the world to come, may juſtly expect the fruits of their delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in this preſent life.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the precedent Verſes of the Chapter we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the firſt Chriſtian Council; in this of a moſt ſolemn Viſitation. The Church being diſquieted with a controverſie raiſed by the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> the Apoſtles and Elders did aſſemble together at Jeruſalem in order to the determining of it. Every one of them ſingly was a Star devoted by his office to lead men to Chriſt: but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together and condenſed into a Council they become a moſt bright and glorious Conſtellation, every way prepared by the emanations of light to guide the Church in this obſcure concernment. Their authority was ſo illuſtrious and commanding; that their decree was received, where the debate firſt began, with teſtimonies of univerſall joy and ſatisfaction. If any did retain their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentiments; yet they were ſo pious and modeſt, as to keep them to themſelves, and not to hazard the peace
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51243:4"/>of the Church by an imprudent publication.</p>
            <p>After the Apoſtle had ſeen the good effects of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, he reſolves upon this Viſitation. Though S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> differed from him in the election of an Aſſiſtant (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. The Viſiters. While our bleſſed Lord had his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the earth, he did not depoſite the regiment of the Church in the hands of others, but kept it in his own, and therefore he is ſtiled <hi>the Apoſtle Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>and Biſhop</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. To this function he received his Conſecration, when the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon him. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38.

            <p n="4">4 Here is the place, where the Viſitation is to be held, <hi>In every city, where we have preached the Word of the Lord. In every City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plantation of the Church was firſt begun in Cities, inſomuch that the words Infidell and Pagan, that is, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting in a village, became Synonimous, or terms of the ſame ſignification. When the Diſciples were made fiſhers of men, they caſt their nets where there was the greateſt confluence and expectations of ſucceſs. When the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were increaſed to ſuch a number, that one place had not capacity enough to entertain them, they were not like Bees, when they ſwarm, put into a hive, which had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon that from which they came. Though they worſhipped God in their apartments, yet they continued to be one and the ſame Society. The Unity of the Church was no more prejudiced by this diviſion into divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; then the unity of Faith by the diviſion of the Bible into Chapters and Verſes. In the moſt eminent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, although there muſt neceſſarily be more Aſſemblies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51243:6"/>then one: yet we read of the Church in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.2. Acts 13.1. Acts 8.1.</note> the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All of them being imbodyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Numericall Government, made but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Elders were conſtituted to take the immediate care of them: yet what they did was onely in a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, and dependance upon the Apoſtles; to whom the power of Ruling was ſo far appropriated, that nothing could be Authentick, and have the impreſs of Authority without their conſent; and therefore notwithſtanding the Presbyters in every City, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did challenge to themſelves the power of Viſitation. This power did not extend to all Cities, but thoſe onely, <hi>where they had preached the Word of the Lord.</hi> The Apoſtolicall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not exerciſed in every place, but confined to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain precinct. Every Star did move in his own Orb. When S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>his boaſting according to the meaſure of the rule,</hi>

               <hi>and not in anothers line,</hi> he intimates, that every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had his Bounds and Province. The words allude to the meaſure, whereby Surveyers uſe to adjuſt the rights of others, and aſſign to every one their proper allotment: or to the white Line, which the Agoniſticall law did oblige Racers to conform their courſe unto, and by no means to run over. They did not viſit in every City, but thoſe in which they preached. Though they had a commiſſion to teach in all the world, yet they had none to govern, but where they taught with ſucceſs, &amp; gained Proſelytes to the Faith. Thoſe who lived without the pale of the Church, like the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propriety was ſettled, were <hi>primi occupantis.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who took the firſt poſſeſſion of their minds, had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar right to the Government of them. The vanquiſhed did lie under an obligation to ſubmit to the laws and regiment of their Conquerour. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

They ſtanding in a paternall relation to ſuch, who were begotten again by the Word which they had preached, it would have been an omiſſion of Duty not to have intereſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the nurture of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here is the end and deſign of the Viſitation, to <hi>ſee how they do.</hi> Though in the Greek we have onely theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet the Syriack verſion is as full as ours, <hi>ut videamus, quid agant.</hi> Theſe Apoſtles knew, that thoſe whom they converted to the Faith, were obnoxious to many diſtempers. In the converted <hi>Jews</hi> there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſome <hi>faeces</hi> of their former diſeaſe. They nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeated the Bread of Life, and made it their choice to pick and eat the rubbiſh of the partition Wall, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had demoliſhed. The Rights of the Law, which expired at the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by this time had an honourable interment, they attempted to pull out of their graves, and give a reſurrection to them. The converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not totally delivered from the power of former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and education. Amidſt theſe circumſtances the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Spirit was not backward to act his part. The Sun of Righteouſneſs could no ſooner in any place appear above the Horizon; but he did endeavour to raiſe his miſts in order to the obſcuring of him. Some of his Inſtruments were animated with ſo much confidence, as to arrogate to themſelves the dignity, which is peculiar to the Son of God. <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who is ſtiled his firſt born,<note place="margin">Epiph. l. <hi>1.</hi> tom. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>55.</hi>
               </note> did not content himſelf with this uſurpation, but invaded the Rights of the Sacred Trinity. He aſſerted, he was the Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> the Son among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In the new Heavens there were ſome Planets, which did affect an erratick motion. In the new earth ſome weeds preſently ſprang up. In Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe regained, the temptation began at the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51243:7"/>There was a ſcience falſly ſo called, which gave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to the <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi> They pretended to know how to ſecure their Title to the Heavenly Purchaſe; and yet to deny the Lord that bought them. The Grace of God, which teacheth ſobriety, they found a way to turn into wantonneſs, and make it a Pander to their impure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites They were impatient to ſit under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtles, being deſirous to inveſt themſelves with the Preeminence. They did <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or order, which was of Divine Erection. In theſe circumſtances among the influences of ſo many infectious examples, the Brethren being not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the peril of contagion, the Holy Apoſtles were ſolicitous about their Welfare, and make this motion, <hi>Let us viſit our Brethren, and ſee how they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parts of the Text being thus explained, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to two Heads. A diſeaſe, which <hi>the Brethren</hi> are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be obnoxious to. A remedy, namely, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall or Epiſcopall Authority and Inſpection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A diſeaſe. The Greek Scholiaſt obſerves, that the Apoſtle went to them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as a Phyſitian goes to his Patients. The beſt of men, in this military and ſublunary State, are apt to fall into Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>This will be very conſpicuous, if we conſider the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary corruption, which is in all by nature. The remains of it in thoſe who are renewed by Grace. The pronity of the Tempter to ſolicite theſe remains, and invite them forth into Act.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The hereditary corruption in all by nature. When the firſt Man was formed, Divine Wiſdom, to oblige him to ſuch a degree of Circumſpection as might prevent his deviation, was pleaſed to enact, that if he perſevered in his allegiance, his offspring ſhould reap the benefit of his obedience: but if he tranſgreſſed, the diſadvantage ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51243:7"/>accrew to them. This is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the law of Adam,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. Even as earthly Princes uſe to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their Subjects to a loyall deportment by conferring ſuch honour upon them as deſcends upon their Poſterity: and to deterr them from Treaſon, by making their Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have the greateſt ſhare in their affections, obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the conſequences of their diſloyalty. Upon this account, when <hi>Adam</hi> was made a Lord, the dignity was conveyed in theſe words, <hi>Let them have dominion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> which intimates that the honour was not to ſtay in him, but to deſcend upon his Poſterity. The Minatory Law, in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die, the Greek Interpreters read, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>in the day that ye eat thereof, ye ſhall die;</hi> which ſignifies, that the curſe did not terminate in his perſon, but was entailed upon his Poſterity. <hi>Adam</hi> violating the law in the moſt aggravating circumſtances, believing the ſerpent and a woman, in a report which did make a moſt diſhonourable reflexion upon his Creator, ſo ſoon as he had received ſo ſignall a benefit from him, as his Exiſtence, was placed in a Paradiſe adorned with the higheſt gratifications of ſence, furniſhed with abilities ſutable to the demands of the Law, he drew the curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf and his poſterity. Upon this account there comes to be an attainder of bloud, and all, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from him, are infected with an hereditary diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In this there is ſuch a degree of Notoriety, that there are ſcarcely any whoſe obſervation it hath eſcaped. This is the diſeaſe, which the Moraliſt ſaies, <hi>Socrates</hi> did endeavour to cure. <hi>Plato</hi>'s Preexiſtence of Souls, and their impriſonment in the body for their delinquency, is but an obſcure delineation of the repreſentative Preexiſtence of the Souls of all men in their firſt Parent, and the miſery they are expoſed unto in the body, upon the account of their delinquency in their repreſentative State. <hi>Origen</hi>

They ſay, the reaſon why it is inſerted <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.4. where the Generations of Heaven are mentioned, is to intimate, that man, as he came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his primitive ſtate, was perfect: and <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.18. where <hi>Pharez</hi> is ſpoken of, to import, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Pharez</hi> is the perſon deſigned to take away this defect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there is an hereditary diſtemper in all by Nature, ſo likewiſe there are ſome remains of it in thoſe who are renewed by Grace. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was caught up into the third heaven, complains of a body of ſin. The Ivy hath ſo inſinuated it ſelf into the wall, that there are ſmall hopes of a totall extirpation, till death comes, and the wall be pulled down. Divine Wiſdom, though <hi>Carthage</hi> be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, is pleaſed not utterly to demoliſh it, that the gifts and graces which are conferred by the Holy Spirit may be kept in exerciſe. <hi>Theophilus,</hi> when he took down the Idols in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſuffered one to remain in a publick place, that thoſe who were converted from them to the living God, might have daily occaſion to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a remembrance of their former folly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe remains the infernall Spirit makes it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to invite and draw forth into act. He is ſtiled by the <hi>Hebrews</hi>

            <p>He that conſiders the morbifick matter, which is in all by Nature, the <hi>faeces</hi> and remains of it in the beſt of Men during their militant ſtate, the endeavours of the Prince of the air to infect it with his impure temptations, will not wonder, that thoſe who breathe in it ſhould be obnoxious to diſtempers.</p>
            <p>So much of the Diſeaſe in generall ſuppoſed in the Text. And now for our more diſtinct information, I ſhall nominate ſome particular diſtempers, which have no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſpect upon the peace and proſperity of the Church. Theſe are <hi>in corde, in ore, in aure, in opere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In corde,</hi> as pride. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> propheſies of <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous times in the laſt days,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. in his catalogue of thoſe who make them, the proud and high-minded are mentioned. This is a diſtemper, which thoſe who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a right to be enrolled among Chriſtians, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from, and hath a Minatory aſpect upon the true intereſt and welfare of the Church. When men make proud reflexions upon their own imaginary Worth, and are poſſeſſed with high thoughts of it, they are preſently ſurpriſed with deſires that others may be of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: this puts them upon excogitating methods, how to make themſelves known, and finding that this cannot be done ſo long as they continue in the crowd, (they being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51243:9"/>not tall enough to make themſelves more conſpicuous then other men) they reſolve upon a ſeparation: and for the juſtification of it, ſet their wits a work to condemn that Church which their own ambition hath divorced them from. Thus with an unuſuall degree of confidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be wiſer then others, they do by degrees inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an Opinion into thoſe who are weak, and of a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent meaning, that they are ſo indeed. By this means they gain a Party to themſelves, ſet open a door to Ataxy, bring contempt upon Government, expoſe publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to neglect, and like the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people from going to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Heroſtratus.</note> that the temple of <hi>Diana</hi> was ſet on fire by one who had no other inducement but to make himſelf a name: and that when <hi>Tiberius</hi> moved the Senate to put <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the number of their Gods, the onely reaſon why they did it not, was becauſe that they themſelves did not make the firſt motion. There is nothing more injurious to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, and that Temple which is of his erection, then this diſtemper. By this means Idols are preferred before Him, his Church put into flames, and all that is Sacred, and devoted to his honour, calcined, and converted into aſhes. But let all ſuch perſons have a care: The Lord of Hoſts is their enemy. He ſets himſelf in battel againſt them: and that diſdain, which they conſtantly breathe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliges all men, no man loves to be contemned, and that Perſon is but in an ill condition, who hath neither the love of God nor Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In Ore.</hi> When pride hath formed men into parties, the next ſtep they take is by reproaches to ruine the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe who differ from them, and impede the accompliſhment of their deſign. Reputation being to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what feathers are to arrows, making them fly the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pierce the deeper, they deſire to deprive their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of this advantage.

Theſe take pleaſure to contemplate in their Engyſcopes thoſe inconveniences which are at hand; and magnifie them into amazing and terrifying proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but never uſe their Teleſcopes to view the dreadfull Calamities which are afar off, and will certainly attend the ſubverſion of the preſent Polity. He is very much a ſtranger to the nature of the Church, who believes, it can continue without order: and he is as much a ſtranger to our affairs, who conceives, if the preſent Order had a period put unto it, that the Diſſenters would ever pitch upon any one Way, in the which they would all agree.

            <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken of the Diſeaſe, both in general and particular, which is ſuppoſed in the Text. And now I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51243:12"/>ſhall paſs on to the Remedy, namely, an Apoſtolicall or Epiſcopall Authority and Inſpection. What S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, was not an act of Charity onely, but Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Primitive age, which was uſed in order to the preventing and healing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. As our bleſſed Lord retained the Power in his own hand during his reſidence upon the Earth, ſo likewiſe did his Apoſtles. And therefore as he is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. ſo their Office <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Churches within a certain precinct was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. S. <hi>James</hi> was ſettled betimes at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> for this Sacred purpoſe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt coming,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.18, 19.</note> found him reſiding upon his Epiſcopall Charge: at his laſt both him and his Elders in a moſt ſolemn Aſſembly.<note place="margin">Acts 21.18.</note> The Brethren came from him to <hi>Antioch</hi> as their Biſhop about Eccleſiaſticall Concerns.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.12.</note> Although others of the Apoſtles were preſent at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15.20.</note> yet the Canon of the Council was drawn up in his words. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaies,<note place="margin">

            <p>This ſettlement was made immediately after the Paſſion of our Lord as a pattern for the reſt of the Apoſtles to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in their ſeverall Plantations. As the Goſpel was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through all Nations, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 24.27. ſo likewiſe the Law, whereby the converted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be governed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> in order to the Reforming ſome abuſes at <hi>Corinth,</hi> tacitely makes an appeal to it, as the place from which the Word of the Lord firſt came, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.36. There being an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that all things in every place ſhould come to a fulneſs of growth, and be ripened into an exactneſs of Order in a moment; Divine providence ſettled at firſt this ſenſible rule for all, who were intereſted in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, to operate by, and come up unto, as the circumſtances of every place would permit. And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51243:13"/>therefore in a Conformity to it, we read of <hi>Titus</hi> being left in <hi>Crete,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Their not reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding always in thoſe places, can be no more an argument of their not being Biſhops there, then it would be, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt was not King of <hi>England;</hi> becauſe our Chronicle repreſents him ſometimes in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreeable likewiſe to this pattern are the ſeven Angels enthroned in the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> by the approbation of our bleſſed Lord, as is manifeſt by his letters to them, in which he commends thoſe Vertues, which did appear in the diſcharge of their Function. His right hand was the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which thoſe <hi>Pleiades</hi> were fixed.</p>
            <p>They cannot (as ſome would perſwade us) ſignifie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches. The Churches are ſtiled Candleſticks, the Angels Stars. So long as Stars are of a nature diſtinct from Candleſticks, the Angels muſt import ſome thing different from the Churches.</p>
            <p>Neither can they be ſeven Colleges of Elders; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> properly denotes one individual. This is the conſtant import of it in all other parts of holy Writ: and there is nothing in the Context, which may oblige us to depart from the cuſtomary ſignification. The plurall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> c. 2. v. 24. hath no neceſſary relation to the Angel of <hi>Thyatira;</hi> but may without any incongruity be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe who are mentioned v. 23. <hi>I will give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you according to his works;</hi> that is, you who have received the doctrine of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> ſhall receive puniſhment according to the merit of your crime: and then it follows, but I ſay unto you, and to the reſt, which have not this Doctrine. It is a received Rule, that we are not to deſert the proper import of any word, and flie to an improper, but where thoſe things which ſtand in conjunction put a neceſſity upon us.</p>
            <p>Neither can the ſeven Angels be ſeven Paſtours of ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51243:13"/>many particular Congregations. For all, which did adhere to the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Lydian Aſia,</hi> are contained under the Seven Churches: and it will be very difficult for any to believe, that there were no more Congregations within that Compaſs. In <hi>Epheſus</hi> alone, where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Word of the Lord mightily grew, Acts</hi> 19.20. there could be no fewer then that number. Oratories and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Convention could be of no great capacity in thoſe times, when Chriſtians were hindred from building by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtorms of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is nothing left for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſignifie but one Individuall Perſon having the care and inſpection of divers Congregations. The beſt Records next unto the Scripture inform us, that <hi>Polycarp</hi> one undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in a power of this Latitude, was the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> From whence we may eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, what we are to determine concerning the reſt; all the ſeven Stars being repreſented without any diſparity in their Magnitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with theſe Seven muſt not be looked upon as Preſidents, or Chairmen onely, having a Primacy of Order among the Presbyters. It is moſt evident, that they had not onely a power to Viſit, and govern the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Deacons and Elders themſelves.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.10. &amp; 5.22.17, 19.</note> Theſe they did examine, ordain, provide for their maintenance, had Authority to receive an accuſation againſt them,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.11. &amp; 8.10. 1 Tim. 5.21.</note> ſtop the mouths of ſuch who did teach falſe doctrine, reject the Hereticall; and are charged in their ſeverall Conſiſtories to prejudice no man, nor to be byaſſed with any partiall regards.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.2. Rev. 2.20.</note> The Angel of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended for trying thoſe who pretended to be Apoſtles: of <hi>Thyatira</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ſuffering ſuch as did teach and ſeduce the people: which can argue no leſs then a Superiority veſted in them over the Paſtours and Teachers of thoſe Churches.</p>
            <p>If the power had not been in theſe Perſons alone, why
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51243:14"/>is the Charge directed to them, commendation given, when performed; reprehenſion, when neglected, without the leaſt mention of any coordinate Society? Had they been in the quality of Chairmen onely (whoſe office is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Order in the Convention) without any concluſive power in themſelves, the doing of the things would not have been impoſed as their duty, but the <hi>modus</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how they were to be done: namely not in a confuſed and tumultuary way, but in methods agreeable to the Rules of all regular Societies.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded <hi>to fight the good fight,</hi> lay hold on eternal life; to keep that which was committed to him: and <hi>Titus</hi> to ſpeak the things which become ſound Doctrine, rebuke with all Authority, avoid fooliſh que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: we may as well conclude, that theſe things were not to be done without the concurrence of the Elders, as thoſe before mentioned. There is nothing expreſſed in the Text which diſcovers any diſcrimination. The independency of their Power is viſible in the deportment of the Apoſtles, whoſe Delegates they were. S. <hi>Paul</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to himſelf alone an Authority to ſet in order what was amiſs, to deliver to Satan, to viſit with his rod, and exempts no degrees, whether Elders or people from being the objects of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of <hi>Clemens</hi> informs us of S. <hi>John's</hi> Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergy and Laity in the Churches of <hi>Aſia. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> of S. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bythinia.</hi>

            <p>Elders indeed were ordained in every City, but not to govern alone. What they did was in a ſubordination to the Apoſtles. The Apoſtles acted without their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: but we never read that they did any thing, for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51243:14"/>which they were not accountable to the Apoſtles. In the caſe of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> the Spirit and Authority of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the firſt mover. In the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the hands of the holy Apoſtle were ſignally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted:</p>
            <p>If any find themſelves diſpoſed to believe, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Viſit and Govern the Clergy by a ſingle Perſon was a remedy adapted onely to the Primitive times; and that in after-ages the Apoſtolicall Superiority was to be laid aſide, and a Parity prevail: they will meet with no ſmall inducement to alter their minds, if they pleaſe impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to weigh theſe three Particulars; The reaſon of the thing, the declaration of God, the practiſe of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The reaſon of the thing. The conſtitution of the Church is ſuch, that it cannot continue long in Repairs without Inſpection and Government. Though the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall is built upon a Rock, yet particular Churches are liable to Dilapidations. And if Government be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no Form ought to take place and be preferred before that which prevailed in the Apoſtolicall Age. Thoſe who are moſt under the power of imagination, will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to fancy, that He who ſhed his precious bloud in order to the purchaſing a Church, ſhould be ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for it, as to leave it in the world without Rules of Settlement: that He who did erect this new Society, ſhould contrary to the method of all Founders, leave it without Statutes preſcribing the modes of Regulation: That He who had the government upon his ſhoulder ſhould aſcend with it to Heaven, and not depoſite it in ſome prudent hands to ſecure his Subjects upon the earth againſt the inevitable inconveniences of Anarchy: that He who is the great Shepherd, ſhould leave his Flock either to be governed by the tremulous deciſions of their own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe the pleaſure of the Civil Powers, which by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51243:15"/>his unerring preſcience, he was aſſured would have for three hundred years the ſame degree of kindneſs for them, as Wolves have for Sheep: that He who after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſpent fourty days upon the Earth, ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, ſhould paſs by in ſilence the regiment of it, which is a matter of no ſmall moment, and hath an inſeperable connexion with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his diſcourſe: that He who gave a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Apoſtles undoubtedly containing ſomething over and above the dictates of Nature, (which are, that the Church muſt be governed, in the Government there muſt be a Superiority in ſome, a Subordination in others. Superiours muſt have all becoming regards expreſſed to them, Inferiours be accountable for the violation of their Rules.) and yet expreſs nothing concerning the particular form of Government, which is the onely poſitive which could have been added to what the Light of Nature gives us the perception of. Though it is too great a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to determine, what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed, by what we conceive he ought to appoint; our intellects being no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges of the Methods of his Wiſdom: yet when we find by Revelation, that he hath inſtituted a Church, would have this Church to be one, this one Church to be well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, that ſome mode of Government is of indiſpenſable neceſſity in order to this end; it is not unbecoming our Chriſtian humility to pronounce, that he hath appointed a particular Form. He who wills the end, never fails to contrive the means which conduce to it. Amongſt the objects of our Belief we do not onely rank thoſe things which are found in the Scripture in particular propoſitions, but whatſoever hath an inſeperable connexion with ſuch Axioms.</p>
            <p>And if it be reaſonable to believe, that our bleſſed Lord hath appointed ſome Government; none can make a more juſt claim to be it, then that which was practiſed by his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51243:15"/>holy Apoſtles, who were inſpired by his Spirit, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an intimate converſe with him, did enjoy the moſt advantageous opportunities to gain a full comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his mind. This certainly hath the beſt right to be the Standard, whereby all Models are to be tried, and from whence they are to receive their allowance or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance, according as they appear conformable or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it. Though an argument from Apoſtolicall Practice in generall may fail, as is evident by the Love-feaſts, the community of Goods, the office of Deaconiſſes: yet when it is derived from ſuch a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Practice as is grounded upon univerſall Reaſon, and not upon peculiar reſpects, and incommunicable circumſtances; the validity of it muſt be acknowledged. Thoſe who have made the moſt ſcrupulous inquiry into the Government of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, can find nothing in it of an inſeparable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to that Age. It is true, the Unction whereby they were qualified for it, was not of the vulgar Compoſition. The holy Spirit gave them an unerring conduct in framing Rules of Diſcipline; a power to aſſert the authority of their actions by miraculous operations: yet their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely to Govern was ordinary, and doth import no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what might be enjoyed by the Rulers of the Church in after-ages. The power may deſcend, where the ſame gifts and degrees of Aptitude to uſe it, do not. <hi>Commodus</hi> was inferiour to <hi>Antoninus</hi> in politicall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and yet did inherit his Power in the amplitude of it. <hi>Caligula</hi> was not comparable to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonicall skill, and yet it would be injuſtice to deny him a place in the Imperiall Succeſſion. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> was qualified for the exerciſe of his Regall Authority by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative meaſures of Wiſdom, yet there is no incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to aſſert, that <hi>Reboboam,</hi> although he did not ſucceed him in the latitude of his Sapience, yet he did in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The Apoſtolicall power is not too big for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51243:16"/>management of thoſe who are not inveſted with miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts. If a Prince who can do no miracles, may be duly qualified to rule a whole Nation in Civil concerns; undoubtedly one Perſon may be fit to ſuperintend in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall within a certain Segment or Diviſion of it, although he cannot <hi>raiſe the dead,</hi> or <hi>remove mountains.</hi> The reaſon of Apoſtolicall Gifts was peculiar to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the firſt Age; but the reaſon of the Power and Government continues. Prelacy now hath the ſame apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to ſecure the ends of the Church as it had in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times. A Superintendency over the Clergy is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary. Our work is of the ſame importance and difficulty. We have the ſame weakneſſes of nature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to errour and folly: no greater meaſures of Grace to ſecure us againſt the importunity of Temptation. And there is ſome reaſon to believe, that invitations to evil are now more acuminated. We are fallen into the dregs of the laſt Days, when the Tempter is nearer to his eternall Confinement; and therefore we may expect the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous expreſſions of his malice. Nature at the approaches of Death uſually puts forth the utmoſt of her activity. A Stone in its deſcent increaſeth in the celerity of its Motion, as it comes nearer the Center.</p>
            <p>This Imparity hath a naturall idoneity to prevent Ataxy; and therefore it hath been generally conſented to as a moſt efficacious Antidote againſt it. Upon this account in all armies there is a Generall. Amongſt the Elders of the Synagogues there was a chief Ruler: amongſt the Prieſts of the <hi>Heathen Deities, Sacerdos maximus.</hi> In the College of the <hi>Druides praeſt unus,</hi>

               <hi>qui ſummam inter eos habet Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem,</hi> are the words of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſual Introduction to diſorder is, when there are different judgements among thoſe who are governed, and a mutiny in thoſe who Govern, betwixt their private intereſts as Men, and publick as Governours. When the Power
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51243:16"/>is lodged in a ſingle Perſon, thoſe two intereſts are more cloſely compacted and blended together: and there is a greater probability of an union of judgements, when all within a certain precinct lie under an obligation to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the reaſon of one, then when they are to take their meaſures from the Judgements of many. Of this we need no other confirmation but our own Experience; our diverſities of Opinion then commencing, and a Deluge of errour breaking in upon us when an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <hi>parity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</hi> Levels are overflown, when Mountains lie dry. The middle Region is filled with clouds and diſorder, when the upper is quiet and ſerene. <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no obſcure type of the Church, was built upon a hill. The Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> a lively emblem of it, found no reſt, till it came to ſettle upon <hi>Mount Ararat.</hi> S. <hi>Jerome</hi> tells us, that Prelacy was introduced <hi>in remedium Schiſmatis,</hi> as a cure to thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which did menace the Church with Diſſolution. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions now are as wide and minatory as in the Primitive times; and there is no reaſon to believe, but that the ſame Remedy, if prejudice did not impede the due Application, might be as ſoveraign and energeticall in order to the Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. Thoſe who conceive that this form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was calculated for the Apoſtolicall Meridian one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, make the Apoſtles, (whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> repreſents as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons intereſted in the foundation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.) like onely to Scaffolds in a Building, which are taken down ſo ſoon as the Edifice is completed, and aſſert that which hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to demoliſh all which is of their Erection. For if they may not be imitated in ruling the Church, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in teaching, baptizing or adminiſtring the Supper. It may with as much facility be aſſerted, that all theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were commanded onely to be uſed in the Primitive times: and ſo a fair way will be made for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Enthuſiaſticall pretences, the <hi>ſeculum Spiritûs Sancti,</hi> and the laying aſide the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51243:17"/>a ſuperannuated Calendar.</p>
            <p>All this, if rightly conſidered, can demonſtrate no leſs, then that there is the ſame reaſon now for an imparity in Eccleſiaſticall Government, as was in the Apoſtolicall age: and if the ſame, then ſuppoſing it was agreeable to the Divine Will in that period of time, it muſt neceſſarily be ſo ſtill. For the will of every rational Agent never altering but with reaſon, ſo long as the reaſon continues the ſame, it muſt be preſumed, that there is no mutation in his will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Reaſon of the thing, ſo the declaration of God argues the perpetuity of Apoſtolicall Government. After the Apoſtles had received their Authority at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they were more ſolemnly inaugurated in <hi>Galilee</hi> (as it is believed) in the preſence of five hundred Brethren,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.21, 22, 23.</note> where the terms of their Commiſſion were more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated. A poſitive injunction is given <hi>to teach, baptize, and inſtruct all nations to obſerve what ſoever was commanded them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> Amongſt thoſe things which they received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, one was to govern the Church, and to challenge obedience from all whether Miniſters or People. Of this we may have a competent aſſurance, if we conſider their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which is no bad interpreter of the ambiguities of their Commiſſion; they being under the conduct of a Spirit, which would not permit them to tranſgreſs the juſt limits of it. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a ſaying, that every mans Apoſtle is as himſelf: to which there is an alluſion in thoſe words, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me.</hi> The Apoſtles being perſons, whoſe wills were reſigned up to the will of him who ſent them: there is more then an ordinary preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their deportment was but a tranſcript of that Copy, which they received from him. To their practice we may add, as a further Confirmation, the words of our bleſſed Lord; <hi>as my Father ſent me; ſo ſend I you.</hi> The commiſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as an Apoſtle did undoubtedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51243:17"/>to a Superintendency over the Clergy as well as the Laity: the particle <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> will juſtifie us in aſſerting the ſame of that, which the Apoſtles received from him there being nothing attributed to them in this particular, but what hath a fair conſiſtency with their finite Capacities. As the Father gave the Keys to him, ſo he gave them to the Apoſtles. As the Father gave him a Throne, ſo he gave them Twelve to ſit upon, and <hi>judge the Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> and therefore as his Juriſdiction did extend to all, whether Miniſter or People; ſo muſt theirs be neceſſarily of the ſame latitude. And for their greater encouragement to encounter thoſe difficulties, which the exerciſe of their Authority might expoſe them to, he aſſures them by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a propitious influence not onely to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to themſelves, but thoſe who ſhould ſucceed them even to the end of the World. <hi>Lo I am with you</hi>

In the words there is an accommodation to the manner of Speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> which divide the time from the Creation to the finall Period of the mundane Syſtem, into two Ages; the firſt extending to the Coming of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Diſſolution of all things: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>To this S. <hi>Paul</hi> is very agreeable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. where he aſſerts that the Apoſtles were given <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, 13.</note> till all be brought into the unity of the Faith. This is the end of this moſt tranſcendent Gift, which hath not yet obtained a full accompliſhment: and therefore if the means muſt continue till the end be obtained, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51243:18"/>Function is not yet arrived at its finall Period. If it be objected, that this argument will conclude as well for the duration of Prophets and Evangeliſts, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſame Verſe: we may reply with ſecurity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that there is no inconvenience, if it do ſo. By Prophets we are not obliged from any thing in the Text to underſtand any other Perſons, then ſuch as had an excellent skill to preach the Goſpel out of the Books of the Old Teſtament, ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were. When the gift of Prophecy is mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of myſteries,</hi> namely Evangelical Doctrines locked up in the figures of the Law and the predictions of the Prophets, is immediately added as an <hi>exegeſis</hi> of it. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are ſuch, as had a profound inſight into the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as contained in the writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and could with ſingular dexterity open and explain its true importance. It is obſervable, that this word was not in uſe till a conſiderable part of the New Teſtament was penned. In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which hath an early date, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſecondly Prophets; and the method which he uſeth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſeems to engage him to give the third Place to Evangeliſts: yet he paſſeth them by in ſilence, the Church at that time being a ſtranger to the denomination.</p>
            <p>Both theſe, as they ſtood in relation to Government, were of the ſame order, namely Suffragans to the holy Apoſtles: the Prophets are joyned with them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. We read of <hi>their impoſition of hands</hi> in an Apoſtolicall manner, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. <hi>Timothy,</hi> who is enjoined to do the work of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, did cooperate with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and miniſter to him in his Eccleſiaſticall concerns.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I ſee no reaſon why ſuch perſons may not ſtill be continued. Biſhops are Succeſſors in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the Apoſtles, their Suffragans to the Prophets and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51243:18"/>Evangeliſts. It is to be noted, that as the Apoſtles are joined with theſe two in the ſame Verſe: ſo theſe are with Paſtours and Teachers; that is Elders, which were ſet over particular Congregations, and Deacons (as <hi>Theophylact</hi> aſſerts) which did occaſionally teach and help the Elders in their Miniſteriall Function,<note place="margin">In Ep. ad <hi>Eph.</hi> c. <hi>4.11.</hi>
               </note> and therefore are ſaid to be given <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſame end is prefixed for all of them, namely, the edifying the Body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> and the ſame term of time ſet out for their duration, till all come into the unity of the Faith. Therefore if Paſtours and Teachers are to continue in the Church, we have reaſon to believe the ſame concerning Prophets and Evangeliſts. The thing may remain, although there be an innovation in the Names.</p>
            <p>The firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> is very conſonant to what hath been aſſerted. After the preſcribing Rules;<note place="margin">C. <hi>6.</hi> v. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> how to regulate his deportment in the Church of God, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with what prudence to exerciſe his Superiority over an Elder, he leaves this injunction with him, I charge thee <hi>to keep the Commandment untill the appearing of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The mortality of <hi>Timothy</hi> rendring it impoſſible to do this in his own perſon, it is neceſſarily imployed, that there ſhall be a ſucceſſion of ſome with the like Authority even to the ſecond Coming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Commandment we muſt not underſtand onely what is expreſſed in the precedent Verſe concerning <hi>fighting the good fight,</hi> but the ſyſteme of rules delivered in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſignanter,</hi> muſt import what is principally commanded in it. That is principally enjoyned, which hath the moſt immediate connexion with the end for which it was written. The end of the penning of it was to inſtruct <hi>Timothy</hi> how to behave himſelf in the Church: therefore the precepts in the body of the Epiſtle, in particular thoſe which relate to an Elder having the moſt direct aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon this end, muſt neceſſarily be contained in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51243:19"/>command which <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged to keep.</p>
            <p>By the appearing of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> we are not obliged to underſtand <hi>Timothy</hi>'s deceaſe. The time of death is never ſo ſtiled by S. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other in any part of Holy Writ: and it is not ſafe and becoming to attribute to the Apoſtle a manner of ſpeaking, which neither he, nor any before him did ever uſe. Whereas the laſt coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is frequently ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the Context, which is no bad Interpreter,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.1. Tit. 2.13.</note> doth determine it to this ſence in this place; for it imports ſuch an appearance, as the bleſſed and onely Potentate ſhall ſhew <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>tempore, quod ipſe novit,</hi> namely at the Day of Judgement, the knowledge of which He hath entirely reſerved to himſelf.</p>
            <p>All this can amount to no leſs then a Declaration of the Divine Pleaſure, that the Apoſtolicall Government and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection ſhould ſtill be continued in the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As a further Evidence we have the practice of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Church, which (if after our moſt diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Holy Scriptures, the ſenſe of any branch of the Divine Will remains ambiguous) is the beſt Interpreter we know of. The Church may be conſidered in a twofold State; either under perſecution, before the converſion of the Emperours to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> or elſe in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great had obtained the throne: There are none who doubt, whether an Apoſtolicall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity prevailed under the laſt Period. All the heſitancy is about the firſt: and yet upon a deliberate reflexion the matter will be beyond diſpute. This is made up of three Centuries, the firſt of which muſt neceſſarily be reſigned to the Apoſtles and their Delegates, who undoubtedly did exerciſe an Epiſcopall Authority, as we have before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. S. <hi>John</hi> the laſt of them who lived to the end of it, and wrote his <hi>Revelation</hi> about the ninety ſeventh Year, deſcribes the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> every one with his tutelary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51243:19"/>Angel, to ſuperintend and govern all, as well Teachers as People; and left them in <hi>Trajans</hi> time under this imparity.</p>
            <p>As for the third Century, we have undoubted inſtances of a like inequality. In the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierom.</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. ad. <hi>Ruff.</hi> Ep. <hi>79.</hi> Pam. Epiſt. <hi>38.</hi> ad <hi>Caldon.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Biſhop excommunicated <hi>Origen</hi> a Presbyter. In the Church of <hi>Carthage, Cyprian</hi> paſſed the ſame cenſure upon <hi>Feliciſſimus.</hi> His taking up a reſolution not to act without the counſel of his Presbyters, was but a voluntary and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent accommodation to ſome circumſtances which were peculiar to him in his Election, and no prejudice to his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchicall Power, which he abundantly aſſerts to be veſted in him by a Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euſ. H. E. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> the deportment of the Biſhops towards <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> in ſuppreſſing his Hereſie is an evident demonſtration of the exiſtence of ſuch Perſons at that time. In the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euſ. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 35.</note> 
               <hi>Novatianus</hi> a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his procuring three Biſhops to conſecrate him, that he might be in a capacity upon equall terms to enter the liſts with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> aſſures us; that they had then a Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſtinct from the Ordination of Elders. <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Presbyters to particular Congregations,<note place="margin">Platin. <hi>in vita</hi> Dionyſ.</note> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the juſt limits of their Pariſhes can evince no leſs then a Superiority over them.</p>
            <p>In the laſt part of the ſecond Century, he that reads the conteſt betwixt <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops about the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of <hi>Eaſter:</hi> the interpoſals of <hi>Polycrates</hi> B. of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>

            <p>This is ſo evident, that <hi>Blondell</hi> himſelf doth freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an Epiſcopall Power to be lodged in a ſingle Perſon about the fortieth year of the ſecond Century. So that granting, that the Apoſtles and their Suffraganes did
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51243:20"/>retain the Regiment of the Church in their own hands du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt, which cannot be denied by any, who impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe the records of the New Teſtament, the queſtion which hath given ſo much Moleſtation to the Chriſtian World, will be reduced to this ſtate: Whether the Church for the ſpace of ſixteen hundred years and upwards hath been without the Apoſtolicall or Epiſcopall Government for the ſpace of Forty onely.</p>
            <p>Should we grant that which can never be proved, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Stream of Apoſtolicall Authority did, like the river <hi>Guadian</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> conceal it ſelf, and run under ground for this little time, this would no more be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to induce us to believe, that the uſe of it is to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded, then it was to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the Regall power was to be laid aſide, becauſe of the <hi>interregnums,</hi> which did frequently put a demurr upon the ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly it doth not appear, that there hath been any ſuch <hi>interregnum</hi> in the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding the obſcurities of the Hiſtory of that time, yet there are catalogues extant of the chiefeſt Cities, as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome;</hi> wherein are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſingle Perſons as diſtinct from and ſuperior to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who were intereſted in the Power of Inſpection du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace which is ſpoken of: and if it was thus in the greater Cities, it is not hard to divine, how it was in the leſs. The Unity of the Church includes a Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Government. The firſt who leads the Van in the catalogue is either an Apoſtle or Evangeliſt, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> in that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> S. <hi>Mark</hi> in that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly were veſted in an Epiſcopall Juriſdiction. Thoſe who conclude it, are acknowledged by all to have the ſame Power: why it ſhould be denied to thoſe in the middle, no good reaſon can be produced, they being repreſented, as having an equall ſhare in the Succeſſion; which cannot be, except they were in the fruition of the ſame Power. A ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51243:20"/>but not in the ſame thing is like a Reſurrection, but not of the ſame Body; which is no reſurrection at all.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe amongſt the nine <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> at <hi>Athens,</hi> one of them the firſt Year to be veſted in a Superiority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Colleagues, as an Apoſtle or an Evangeliſt was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Elders, and the next the conſtitution to be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphized into a Parity, and to continue for forty Years, as <hi>Blondell</hi> conceives the Eccleſiaſticall equality did, and then after the expiration of that Term, the former impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be introduced again: It would be an incongruity ſcarcely to be paralleled to repreſent the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year as a Succeſſor to him of the firſt, he enjoying nothing of his Power: or the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of the forty firſt to him of the fortieth, he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enjoying a Power paramount, which the other was never acquainted with.</p>
            <p>This would be as inconvenient, as if we ſhould make a liſt of the Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> place <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> who was next to him in power, but of a very different nature; the Government being changed, and the Community now under Conſuls.</p>
            <p>It is true, there may be catalogues of ſingle Perſons ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another in a Priority of Order as well as of Power: but this is nothing to our preſent caſe. Here are liſts before us, and all in them repreſented to be upon equall terms, as having a fruition of the ſame Immunities, and the firſt and laſt are confeſſed to have a Superiority of Power over their Colleagues, from whence a computation may be eaſily made, what we may conclude concerning the reſt. Thoſe who ſay, though the Apoſtles ſtand at the head of the Catalogues, yet they are not included in them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the ſenſe of primitive Antiquity, which accounts all in the liſts to be Succeſſours to the Apoſtles. A Succeſſour &amp; a Predeceſſour being relatives, which go always together, if the Succeſſour be in the roll, the Predeceſſour muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be ſo. It will not be eaſie to diſappoint the prevalency
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51243:21"/>of this argument, if the Catalogues may be admitted as Authentick: and why they ſhould not, I ſee no juſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>The variations in them are not uncapable of a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and they argue ſtrongly that they are not the fictions of a private Invention. Forgeries uſe to be too harmonious and uniform in every <hi>punctilio.</hi> They were collected by a skilfull hand,<note place="margin">Euſeb.</note> who had great advantages to poſſeſs himſelf with the true ſenſe of the Monuments of Antiquity.

            <p>It might be added as no prejudice to their Reputation, that they were begun by the Apoſtles themſelves, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

            <p>This teſtimony, as it aſſures us that the Catalogues we treat of, were begun by the Apoſtles: ſo likewiſe, that Biſhops in <hi>Clemens</hi>'s time, who lived within the intervall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51243:21"/>under debate, were ſuch as are properly ſo ſtiled; to wit, Perſons veſted in a Superiority over Elders. We never read of rolls or catalogues of meer Presbyters, as lineally deduced from the Apoſtles, conſidered in that ſtate in which they died.<note place="margin">

               </note> whom <hi>Blondell</hi> profeſſeth to follow, if throughly conſidered, will be found to have no favourable aſpect upon his opinion. All that he ſpeaks, amounts to no more then this:</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles and their Delegates during their abode in the world did hold the Government of the Church in their own hands. Theſe in every City conſtituted Elders, which were promiſcuouſly called by the name of Presbyters and Biſhops to rule in a Subordination to themſelves. As the primary Apoſtles, and thoſe who were ordained by their Hands to ſucceed them, began to wear off, there ſprang up a Schiſm among the People not much unlike unto that which diſquieted the Church, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> every one adhering to him as his Apoſtle or primary Biſhop, by whom he had been baptized. <hi>Unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque eos, quos baptizaverat, ſuos eſſe putabat.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was not, whether one ſhould have the Power over them; (the practice of the Apoſtles in ordaining ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſucceed them, was ſo evidentiall and freſh in their memories, that there could be no heſitancy in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) but who was to be the Perſon. In order to the healing this Schiſm, <hi>toto orbe decretum eſt,</hi> it was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally decreed: (whereas before Presbyters did <hi>communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51243:22"/>in a ſubordination to the Apoſtles govern the Church) that now One ſhould be choſen out of their own number, and have a Superintendency over the reſt, as the Apoſtles and their Delegates uſe to have. This is the ſum of what <hi>Jerome</hi> doth deſign.</p>
            <p>The Perſon thus ſet over had not onely the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>but a Primacy of Juriſdiction.</hi> For before this change in the College of the Presbyters there muſt neceſſarily be One, who in the abſence of the Apoſtles had <hi>jus primae Cathedrae.</hi> This is eſſentiall to all regular Conventions, no Order can be maintained without it: therefore by this new Decree ſomething being conferred, which none of the Presbyters did enjoy before, it can be nothing but <hi>primatus juriſdictionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conſtitution was made long before the fortieth year of the ſecond Century.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 85. Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grio.</note> S. <hi>Jerome</hi> calls it an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall tradition, which cannot be true in any proper ſenſe, except it began in the age, in which the Apoſtles lived: and as an evidence of his mind, that he did not ſpeak impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, he gives an example of the practiſe of it in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from the death of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> which was in the eighth Year of <hi>Nero,</hi> above ſeventy Years before <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells aera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Blondels</hi> Apology had been permitted to ſee the light with that concluſion which he himſelf put to it,<note place="margin">Durell <hi>Appen. p</hi> 339.</note> we ſhould have needed no other refutation of his Opinion. For there he did acknowledge Epiſcopacy to be an Apoſtolicall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which he could not with reaſon have aſſerted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he had believed, that its <hi>Epocha</hi> was higher, and more early then the fortieth Year of the ſecond Century.</p>
            <p>In order to the overthrow of the Univerſality of Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it is uſually alledged, that the <hi>Gothick</hi> Churches were governed without it for ſeventy Years till <hi>Ulphilas</hi>'s time: The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> by the <hi>Culdei,</hi> who were Presbyters onely till <hi>Palladius:</hi> that the tranſmarine Churches, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51243:23"/>according to the primitive Standard, are now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: and laſtly that the Hierarchy amongſt us is not the ſame with primitive Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>For the firſt the beſt Authority we have is <hi>Philoſtorgius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ex lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 470. Valeſ.</note> whoſe words when ſummed up, will amount to no more then this: That the <hi>Goths</hi> made an inrode upon ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where Chriſtianity was planted, and took many captives, amongſt which were ſome o the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Theſe being mingled in their converſe with that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People, were inſtrumentall to convert them to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and governed them till <hi>Ulphila's</hi> time their firſt Biſhop.</p>
            <p>In all this there is nothing really prejudiciall to our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It doth not appear, that theſe Presbyters did all this while any thing which was peculiar to a Biſhop. When any of them died, new ones might be ordained by ſome neighbour Prelate. However the matter went, (of which we have but a very defective account, by reaſon of the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Records) the deportment of a few Captives in a caſe of neceſſity, can be of no ſuch Authority as to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Univerſality of Eccleſiaſticall practice. It would be but a weak argument to prove, that the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not univerſally owned by the <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe during their ſeventy years Captivity, they were forced to forbear the practice of ſome of them, as not reconcileable with the circumſtances of Exile.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Church thoſe which report the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpeak nothing which may be a diſſervice to our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſum is, that many of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity, fearing the cruelty of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> fled into <hi>Scotland;</hi> where by their ſolitary and pious life they did commend themſelves in ſuch a degree to the opinion of that Nation, that they were uſually called <hi>Culdci,</hi> that is <hi>Cultores Dei, Worshippers of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Primor.</hi> Brit. <hi>Ecc. p.</hi> 638. <hi>p.</hi> 640.</note> Theſe choſe a Perſon out of their own number to govern them in their Divine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51243:23"/>Concernments. Here is plainly a Biſhop elected onely by his Clergy, who notwithſtanding any thing in the Record, might receive his Conſecration by ſome duly qualified in our Nation, where Hierarchy was undoubtedly ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this period. If any formality was wanting in him, the defect is not to be charged upon their wills, but neceſſity, as appears by the ready entertainment <hi>Palladius</hi> found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who wanted no formality which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> could conferr upon him.</p>
            <p>As for the tranſmarine Churches which are of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, it is very well known, that all of them are not without Epiſcopacy, as in <hi>Denmark, Norwey, Sueden, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Thoſe which are, alledge neceſſity as the reaſon of their firſt Conſtitution. The Reformation being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun amongſt them, not by Biſhops, but the Laity and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy onely, there was good cauſe to believe, if they had ſet up Biſhop againſt Biſhop in the ſame City, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult would have been nothing but confuſion, and ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conteſts, which have no propitious aſpect upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel. The duty of avoiding theſe miſchiefs being grounded upon a natural precept, the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon a poſitive, they did preſume, it was not the will of the Lawgiver, that the poſitive Injunction ſhould oblige them in thoſe circumſtances; but rather yield and give place to the ſuperior Command.</p>
            <p>This neceſſity which was the ground of their conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have pathetically deſired the removal of, and that their condition might become reconcileable with the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an Imparity. When one of the Prelates of our Church at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> had repreſented Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as a fit expedient for the ſuppreſſion of Schiſm and Hereſie, the anſwer of the Preſident in the name of the whole Aſſembly is very well known,<note place="margin">Dur. 118.</note> 
               <hi>Domine, non ſumus adeò foelices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, where the firſt reaſon hath failed, and the Biſhop
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51243:24"/>of the place been converted to the reformed Religion, there they have put their deſires into execution, and expreſſed a readineſs to ſubmit to his Regiment,<note place="margin">Dur. <hi>p</hi> 120.</note> as is manifeſt by the deportment of the Proteſtants in the Province of <hi>Campagne</hi> towards the Biſhop of <hi>Troyes,</hi> when he renounced the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and profeſſed an adherence to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who affirm the preſent Hierarchy not to be the ſame with primitive Epiſcopacy muſt make the difference either rationall, modall, or eſſentiall. A difference of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being the contrivance of imagination is not materiall in the preſent Debate. A modall (conſidering the various condition of Times, the Church in the Apoſtolicall age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under affliction, now in proſperity, then under Heathen Princes, now under Chriſtian, then ſeperated from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Community, now incorporated into it) may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any prejudice to our Aſſertion. Some variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the exerciſe of Juriſdiction, the quality of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth not alter the nature of Government. As the civil Regiment is not changed, when a Prince makes an Eccleſiaſticall Perſon his Chancellour: ſo neither is the Eccleſiaſticall, when a Biſhop conſtitutes a Civil. In the age in which the Church began to have her <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which were perſons of the ſame Moment, deſigned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite matters which might be too great an avocation from religious Worſhip, to which the Clergy are principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted; ſhe did not dream of any diverſity from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Government, but continued with the ſame degree of confidence, to ſtile her Biſhops the Apoſtles ſucceſſours. Theſe civil Helps did make them no more different from what they were before, then a ſtaff in the hand of a man makes him diſtinct from himſelf, when he hath none in it. As for an eſſentiall difference, thoſe who are moſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, will never be able to diſcover any. Primitive Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy was nothing but theregiment of Churches within a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51243:24"/>certain precinct committed to one ſingle Perſon with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Authority as well over the Clergy as Laity. Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in an Apoſtle was authoritative; In the Elders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant and ſubordinate. Prelacy now in the ſubſtance of it is of the ſame importance. Thoſe acceſſions with which it is beautified, and raiſed above the reach of vulgar Contempt by the munificence of Princes, do no more make it of a different <hi>ſpecies</hi> from what it was in the Apoſtolicall age, then <hi>the royall apparel put upon Mordecai</hi> did conſtitute him a man ſpecifically diſtinct from him, who uſe <hi>to ſit in the gate: Moſes</hi> when advanced <hi>in Pharaohs Court,</hi> was the ſame perſon with him who was expoſed <hi>in the Ark of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes.</hi> A child when dreſſed by the nurſe, is the ſame with that which was born naked. The ornamentall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Kings and Queens, which are <hi>nurſing Fathers and Mothers</hi> to the Church, make no greater an alteration.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who endeavour to demonſtrate an Eſſentiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by aſſerting that Biſhops and Presbyters had the ſame Ordination in the Apoſtolicall age, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were then of the ſame Order, whereas now it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; will find reaſon to alter their thoughts, and to believe, that the Ordination then was as diſtinct as it is now, if they pleaſe to take theſe few ſteps.</p>
            <p>The names, Biſhop, Presbyter and Deacon, in Scripture are ambulatory, and not always confined to the ſame order of men. Thoſe who have attempted to evidence, that the word Presbyter ſignifies always a Biſhop, or the word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop a Presbyter, have been more curious then really ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to their own cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Characteriſticall names of the ſuperior Clergy are Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts. The primary Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were known by the firſt, their Suffragans and Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors by the two laſt; yet ſo as by reaſon of their being inveſted in a Power, whereby they were inabled to do what a primary Apoſtle might, they are likewiſe frequently ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51243:25"/>Apoſtles. Upon this account we read of the Apoſtles of the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is ſtiled an Apoſtle of the <hi>Philippians c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> are ſaid to be of note among the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> Ecc. H. c. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> that beſides the twelve, there were many others who were called by that name. For this reaſon S. <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Valeſ. <hi>in</hi> Euſ. H. <hi>tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>Luke, Philemon, Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> have this title in the Greek Menology.</p>
            <p>Theſe had a juriſdiction over Presbyters. <hi>Timothy</hi> was veſted in a power to convent an Elder, and receive an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt him: but we never read of any ſuch Power in an Elder over an Evangeliſt, or an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>This Power was not arbitrary and aſſumed at pleaſure, but communicated to them by Commiſſion. The Apoſtles did nothing in a tumultuary way, but were agreeable in their practice to that pattern and order, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>This Commiſſion was given at their Ordination. This was the uſuall way in the Synagogue, whereby any were admitted to a participation of the Government: and we read of no other in the Church. Therefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy</hi> how to govern, he put him in mind of the gift, which he received at <hi>the laying on of hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Greek Scholiaſt ſpeaks: which plainly intimates, that his gift or faculty to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend did not derive its originall from any Commiſſion, but what he received by the impoſition of Hands.</p>
            <p>Now if their Power was diſtinct, their power by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, their commiſſion by Ordination, the rules of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will oblige us to conclude, that their Ordination was diſtinct; the ſame Ordination cannot produce two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Powers.</p>
            <p>Upon this account we find the Apoſtles, who were at firſt ordained by <hi>Jeſus Ghriſt to preach the Goſpel, Mark</hi> 3.14. when they came to be inveſted with the Government
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51243:25"/>and ſit upon their thrones were ordained anew, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> two of the Seventy and by conſequence ſet apart before,<note place="margin">Euſ. H. <hi>l.</hi> 1.12.</note>

There is ſome reaſon to believe that <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf was twice Ordained.</p>
            <p>The firſt time, about the ſeventh Year of <hi>Claudius</hi> by the Apoſtles own hands, immediately after he had circumciſed him. For his deſign being to take him along with him to preach the Goſpel, no doubt as he circumciſed him, that he might not offend the <hi>Jews:</hi> ſo he ordained him, that he might not offend God, in breaking his Law. No man <hi>taketh this honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God,</hi> as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> Of this we have mention, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stir up the gift of God, which is given thee by the laying on of my hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond time, about the thirteenth Year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> when he was left at <hi>Epheſus</hi> to be Biſhop there. When the Apoſtle writes to him, how to behave himſelf in that Church, he puts him in mind of the gift or faculty which he received at his Conſecration. <hi>Neglect not the gift, which was given by Propheſie, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.

            <p>All this may give us ſome competent aſſurance of the Practice of the univerſall Church. From this practice the deduction of the Divine pleaſure concerning the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Government will be very familiar and eaſie. It cannot be imagined, that it ſhould have ſo univerſall an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in all Places, where there was no Oecumenicall Council to command it, no ſecular Power to enforce it, no want of Pride and Ambition to controul it, had it not been commended to their reception, and made currant by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Signature. No arbitrary contrivance checked with difficulties, and deſtitute of all externall advantages to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Propagation of it, even found ſo ſudden, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and generall an Eſtabliſhment. Had it been a Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the rights and immunities of Presbyters (it being it matter not latent, but apert and manifeſt) no doubt ſome would have been ſo juſt to themſelves, as to have ſtood up in their own Defence: and ſo zealous, as to have encountered it with a direct oppoſition: yet we read
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51243:26"/>nothing of this nature, till three hundred Years after in <hi>Aerius</hi>'s time; and then all the recompence which he received was the infamy of Hereſie. Hereſie being an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the Foundation, and the foundation being incluſive of that which relates to Practice and Government, as well as Doctrine, (in Religious government as well as Civil there is ſomething which is Fundamental) he advancing an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion diametrically oppoſite to what was then reputed the <hi>baſis</hi> of Eccleſiaſticall Policy, did take a compendious courſe to expoſe himſelf to this imputation. His ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Communion of the Church was not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this charge, that being, if we may be allowed to ſpeak properly, Schiſm and not Hereſie. Nor his Arianiſm. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> aſſign him in their Catalogues a place diſtinct from that, which is appropriated to <hi>Arius.</hi> And it will be difficult to find a more authentick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the identity of their Hereſie, than thoſe two have given for the diverſity.</p>
            <p>Had the Epiſcopall Conſtitution been in any reſpect a defection from the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, how comes it to paſs that they themſelves ſhould give countenance to it, by the performance of many acts peculiar to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as hath been already declared? If their practice was not deſigned for imitation, how came the beſt of Men in the ſecond and third Century not to underſtand ſo much, but fall ſo roundly to a Conformity, and without the leaſt heſitancy ſtile their Biſhops the Apoſtles Succeſſours, as moſt evidently appears by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adv. Har. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> de praeſ. c. <hi>32.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Though a deſire to prove a Succeſſion in Apoſtolicall doctrine gave occaſion for what they aſſert in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: yet upon this occaſion they plainly own a Succeſſion in Power and Authority. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proves that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles would not conceal any of the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion from them, becauſe they left them to be their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, <hi>ſuum ipſorum locum magiſterii tradentes,</hi> delivering
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51243:27"/>to them the ſame Power &amp; Authority they themſelves had. It will hardly gain belief in the thoughts of thoſe who are acquainted with the conſequences of Reaſon; that they who made it their election to endure the greateſt torments, rather then to violate the leaſt of the Precepts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould ſo ſoon as He and his Apoſtles had left the World, erect a government contrary to his Inſtitution: that thoſe who were willing to die for the Myſtery of Godlineſs, ſhould make it their choice to live under a branch of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity. I know the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in a ſhort time in the abſence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> made a notorious revolt; yet this is no argument, that theſe pious and holy Men did the ſame after the death of the Apoſtles. What the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, was known to be a defection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was oppoſite to the practice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and encountred with oppoſition from the Beſt of men then living. But this which ſome think fit to ſtile a defection in the Primitive Chriſtians, is exactly conformable to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall practice, and was ſubmitted to by thoſe heroick Spirits, who by Martyrdom gave the World an undoubted aſſurance of their Sincerity and Goodneſs. If the practice of the univerſall Church muſt be totally ſet aſide as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no conſideration in order to the conducting of us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an underſtanding of the Mind of God, one pillar of our Belief will be very much ſhaken: I mean the Authority of ſome particular Books of Holy Writ, for the knowledge of which we are without controverſie in no mean degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to it. No ſmall diminution will be made in our aſſurance, that <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is no part of the Canon, and that S <hi>Paul's</hi> is: that <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> is <hi>Apocryphall,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> not. If cuſtom be of no ſignification it is ſtrange that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould appeal to it, as no unfit Arbitrator to put a period to thoſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which did moleſt the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is ſaid, that of whatſoever conſequence it may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51243:27"/>be in other caſes, yet in this before us it cannot be ſafe to deduce the Divine Will from it; becauſe thoſe who were ingaged in it, did not look upon themſelves as obliged thereunto by any Divine Precept; but on the contrary by enlarging the Church's power as the Churches did enlarge, by conforming Eccleſiaſticall Government to the Civil, by managing Spirituall concerns according to the Canons of Synods, by acknowledging a Subordination to the civil Power, they did manifeſt that they were acted, not by the influence of a Supernall command, but by ſome occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and prudentiall conſiderations.</p>
            <p>To all which I reply in order. 1. The Regiment we contend for, was univerſall acknowledged to have its <hi>baſis</hi> in a Divine right, as moſt evidently appears by the twenty ninth Canon of the fourth generall Council, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to depreſs a Biſhop down to the degree of a Presbyter is Sacriledge.</hi> It will be very difficult to explain how the Synod could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this to be ſacrilegious, except there was a generall belief, that the difference betwixt a Biſhop and Presbyter was made by a Sacred Inſtitution. Upon this account the Author of the Book of Queſtions in S.<note place="margin">Quae. vet. &amp; Nov. Teſt. Q. <hi>97.</hi> tom. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>775.</hi> Frob.</note>

            <p n="2">2. The enlarging Church-power as the Church did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, is no argument againſt the Divine right of it. By the ſame reaſon we may prove, that the power of a Father of a family hath not its foundation in a Divine Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it receives an augmentation, as his Children encreaſe, and falls under divers Modifications, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stations they are placed in: or that the Theocracy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Old Teſtament did not derive its originall from Heaven, becauſe it was of a larger extent, when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſettled in their apartments in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then when they lived in the wilderneſs altogether.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The conforming Eccleſiaſticall Government to the Civil is no juſt preſumption againſt a Divine originall. It doth not appear but that it was the Will of God, that the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which came down from Heaven, ſhould conform it ſelf to the mould it fell into. When the Church was firſt planted, it found the world cantoned into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: in every Province a Metropolis, inferior Cities, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbicarian Regions: in every Metropolis a Proconſul, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City a Defenſor upon which the ſuburbicarian Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did depend. The imitation of this civil Diſpoſition in placing a Biſhop in every City anſwerable to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, in every Metropolis an Arch-Biſhop ſutable to the Proconſul, being of a eminent uſe to invite the People to a ready obedience (they being by cuſtom habituated to the like Regiment in civil concernments) and likewiſe giving the Governours a ſingular advantage to obtain the ends of their Conſtitution, by reaſon of the daily confluences to thoſe Places upon ſecular accounts, there is a high degree of probability, that it was ſutable to the will of him whoſe conſtitutions are always conformable to the deepeſt reaſon. Some footſteps it we find as early as the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Churches were planted in Metropoles, as <hi>Corinth, Theſſalonica, Antioch,</hi> upon which thoſe who in any part
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51243:28"/>of the Province entertained the belief of the Goſpel, had ſome dependence. The ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is inſcribed to all the Saints which are in all <hi>Achaia.</hi> The firſt to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> hath a peculiar aſpect upon all in <hi>Macedonia.</hi>

As the <hi>Romans</hi> when they ſubdued a Country by force of Arms, did conſtitute there a civil Province: ſo the Apoſtles, when they had made a Spirituall conqueſt by the weapons of their warfare, an Eccleſiaſticall.

               </note> Though <hi>Pliny</hi> doth not attribute this honour to <hi>Thyatira,</hi> yet he doth not deny it. The defect of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is fully ſupplyed by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who is not his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in point of Authority. <hi>Philadelphia</hi>'s being placed in the <hi>Notitiae</hi> under <hi>Sardis</hi> is no demonſtration that it was not a Mother-city. The ſame individuall may be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one reſpect, and a Daughter in another. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces themſelves were not all equall, and by conſequence the Mother-city in one Province might be inferior in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dependent in power upon the Metropolis of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We need go no further for an inſtance then our own Nation. Of the two Provinces into which it is divided, one is acknowledged to have a Superiority, and ſome power over the other.</p>
            <p>All this makes it appear, that the conforming Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Government to the Civil is no prejudice to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine originall of it. The Vine which was planted by a Divine hand under the civil Power as a wall of defence, did naturally, according to the will of Him who planted it, adapt it ſelf to the mode of that which it grew againſt. The rain which deſcends from heaven, conforms to the figure of the veſſel it falls into.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Eccleſiaſticall concerns were managed according to the decrees of Councils, but not all of them. The ancient Church was governed by a double rule, the Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and of Councils. The laſt conſiſts either of declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what is contained in Scripture: or elſe conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reſtrain liberty in thoſe things which the Sacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51243:29"/>have left to our choice, either to do or not to do. As for Prelacy, (the eſſence of which lies in a Superiority of an Eccleſiaſticall perſon over Elders within a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct) it was ever owned by the Church as agreeable to the Canon of Scripture. Councils ſuppoſe it to be grounded upon a right more early then themſelves, and never give it a place in the Catalogue of thoſe things which may be or not be the object of their determination. He who thinks fit to conſult the Code of the univerſall Church, cannot remain unacquainted with the truth of this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Churches acknowledgement of her ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the civil Power is reconcileable with a belief that her Government is grounded upon a Divine Right. Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Regiment, which doth undoubtedly derive its origen from Heaven, is in the exerciſe of it ſubordinate to the civil Power. A Father of a family, though he governs his progeny by vertue of the law of God, yet is accountable to his Prince, and limitable by his decrees in the execution of his Authority.<note place="margin">Eph. 3.15.</note> The Churches being ſtiled a family will juſtifie the congruity of this example. The ſupream Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath moulded the Univerſe into Communities, and conſtituted the civil Magiſtrate to be their Guardian. Into theſe Communities he hath let down from Heaven the New Jeruſalem, namely, a Church or Eccleſiaſticall Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with Governours and Laws not onely harm leſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, but ſingularly advantageous to the purpoſes of the civil Conſtitution. And becauſe it is not impoſſible but that the Rulers may degenerate from the true meaning of their Originall, and under a pretence of a Supernall commiſſion undermine the intereſt of the civil Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Magiſtrate is impowered to ſee that they keep within their own bounds, and if they ſwell above their banks, to remand them into their proper channel, if they do not, to protect and defend them againſt the hand of violence. This makes it evident, how the Church may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51243:30"/>be ſubordinate to the ſecular Power, and yet have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment grounded upon a Divine right. It is the Divine pleaſure, that Princes within their own Territories ſhould be ſo far concerned in all cauſes and over all perſons, as to ſee that nothing be done to the prejudice of the Community they are ſet over. From hence doth emerge their right to inhibit, limit, and regulate the execution. Though Chriſt is the immediate Fountain of the Power, yet they have a commanding influence upon the ſtreams which flow from it. Though they may not invade the Offices which are peculiar to the Church, yet they are obliged to ſee that they are duly performed by thoſe to whom they appertain. Though they have not the Power of the Keys; yet in caſe thoſe which have, make uſe of them to open a door to Sedition and Diſorder, they have the Power of the Sword to ſhut it, and prevent the miſchief. If the Church keep within her due bounds, and the ſupream Magiſtrate be of opinion that ſhe doth not, and from hence a conteſt is commenced, ſhe hath no other weapon to defend her ſelf but Prayer and a compoſed Submiſſion to what the preſervation of a good conſcience may expoſe her.</p>
            <p>All this is very far from erecting <hi>imperium in imperio:</hi> it hath nothing in it of a malevolent aſpect upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of Princes. All pretended inconveniences fall with an equall weight upon paternall Government, which undoubtedly, being in nature and time antecedent to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Conſtitution, muſt have a Divine originall.</p>
            <p>And now whoſoever pleaſes to look back and conſider the reaſon of the thing, the declaration of God, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Univerſall Church, which is no bad commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon what is dubious in any Divine appointment, will be under no temptation from any rationall inducement to believe, that the Apoſtolicall authority to govern was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted onely to the Primitive times, and not intended to continue in all Ages.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51243:30"/>
            <p>So much of the Remedy in generall, namely an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall or Epiſcopall Authority, expreſſed in <hi>viſiting the Brethren.</hi> In the next place I will enumerate ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts of this Power, which are of eminent uſe in all Ages for the preventing and healing diſtempers. 1. An Inſpection into the Authority of thoſe who preach. 2. The Doctrine. 3. The lives. 4. The giving rules for the preſerving of Order. 5. The cenſuring thoſe who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Order which is agreed upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Inſpection into the Authority of thoſe who preach. The work of the Miniſtry is of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than to lie open to every one, who by the ſtrength of his fancy can perſwade himſelf that he is fit to diſcharge it. The peace of the Church depends upon the Practice of thoſe who are members of it; their practice upon their judgement: their judgement upon the Doctrine of their Teachers. Theſe have the Helm in their hand, whereby the body of the People is eaſily moved: the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby they are in the neareſt capacity to open the intellect, and let in, or ſhut out Principles which tend to Unity. The Community would not enjoy the leaſt degree of ſecurity, might the private opinion of every Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own Aptitude give him a title to this Office. Men are not competent Judges of their own abilities. The Generality are very partiall, when they take an eſtimate of their intellectuall Powers. Every place is filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the want of Riches and Honour: but we ſeldom meet with any querulous reſentments of the defects of Reaſon and Underſtanding. Indeed S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> but we are apt to ſay, <hi>who is not?</hi> The ſtream runs the faſteſt, where the channel is moſt ſhallow: Thoſe are moſt forward, who have the leaſt acquaintance with the depth of Knowledge. The few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions from the generall Rule, which are duly prepared, are ſo much under the command of humility, that they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51243:31"/>judge themſelves unworthy. The burden of fruit which grows upon theſe branches, bends them into too low and deſpondent thoughts of themſelves.<note place="margin">Socr. <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> When <hi>Ammonius,</hi>

By reaſon of this unfitneſs in Men to judge for themſelves, and to be the fountain of their own Authority, God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Governours of his Church with a power, as to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, ſo to examine every mans pretence; that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity may receive no damage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Doctrine. Thoſe who have a good commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may exceed the bounds of it: and in ſtead of feeding their Flock in wholſom Paſtures, lead them into Boggs, where they will inevitably ſink into an eternall Perdition. Error is damnable as well as vice.

            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51243:31"/>
            <p>Errour puts the higheſt of affronts upon the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. <hi>He that believeth not, maketh him a liar.</hi> It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> of ingratitude. God having enobled us above his other creatures, and placed the difference in Reaſon and Underſtanding, if we keep not this conformable to him, but ſuffer it to be imbaſed with ſentiments which are repugnant to that eternall Reaſon which is in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect, we are unthankfull to him in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted degree. There is no excuſe of importance enough to acquit us from guilt, the fault originally emerging from the voluntary and uncompelled motions of the Will. God hath made a plentifull proviſion for our Information. The holy Scripture is a perfect Digeſt of the divine Pleaſure, ſufficient to inſtruct even the Man of God in the concerns of Salvation. Therefore in caſe he errs about propoſitions of Divinity, he hath nothing to charge but his own will, in whoſe power it was to have ſuſpended his aſſent, and continued the inquiry, till he had been diſintangled and got looſe from all objections. When any object gains ſuch a degree of clarity, there is no fear of deception. We have a ſecurity from the ſupream Veracity, with which it is not conſiſtent, that our perceptive faculty ſhould be ſo formed, as to be impoſed upon, when the object is perſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Error having ſo pernicious and malevolent an aſpect upon that end for which the Church is conſtituted, our Bleſſed Lord hath left a Power with it <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. The lives. Thoſe who are Orthodox in their doctrine,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51243:32"/>may be unorthodox in their converſation. Like <hi>Penelope,</hi> what they do in the day, they may undo at night in the works of darkneſs. <hi>Theophylact</hi> in his Commentary upon this Text, <hi>he opened his mouth and taught, Mat.</hi> 5.2. makes a query, whether the firſt words be not ſuperfluous. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He anſwers, No, becauſe he did teach, when he did not open his mouth, namely, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by his life. There is a preaching in Life, as well as in Doctrine. If Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be taught by the laſt, and debauchery by the firſt, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having an aptitude to make a deeper impreſſion than words, there is ſome probability, they may prevail, and diſappoint the end of what is ſpoken. Though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of a Miniſter doth not make void his Calling,<note place="margin">Art. r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and diſoblige us from uſing his Miniſtry, he ſpeaking not in his own, but in the Name of Chriſt: and the efficacy of his Function depending not upon his dignity, but the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Divine Grace: (A vineyard may be watered with a pipe of lead as well as of ſilver. Seed may grow, although ſown by an impure hand. A ſeal of Braſs may make as fair an impreſſion as one of Gold.) Yet notwithſtanding, when this Sacred Office is imbarked in ſuch a veſſel, it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to meet with many <hi>remora's,</hi> before it can arrive at its proper haven, namely, the Conſcience. The Didacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part of the diſcourſe of ſuch a Perſon, though never ſo cogent, is uſually entertained by all vulgar Capacities, who more conſider, what he is that ſpeaks, then what is ſpoken, with the ſame reſentment that a Jewel is which is found in the dirt: The feculent matter about it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates a diſcredit to it, and conceals the true value from all but a few Artiſts. When one of a bad life had given excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent counſell to the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> about their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gell.</hi> noct. Att. l. <hi>18.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> his improbity did ſo much diſparage the advice, though abſolutely neceſſary; that it might not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to paſs into a Law as it came from him: but one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51243:32"/>vertuous, though of no good Elocution, was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak the ſame thing in ſuch words as he could, and then unanimouſly as from him the ſtamp of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was impreſſed upon it. What <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſpeaks of the Biſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is very applicable here. A good man, when ſilent, can do more than he who is bad, although he ſpeak in a Stile enameled with the richeſt Tropes and Figures in Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>As the Didacticall part of his diſcourſe is apt to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſo the Elencticall will in all probability be treated with ſcorn and contempt. To reprove is an act which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Authority, and no man can abide the another ſhould exerciſe Authority over him in that thing in which they are both equall. If reprehenſion doth any good, it produceth ſorrow in him who is the object of it. The pleaſure which hearers take to conſider that he which ſpeaks lies under the ſame guilt which he reproves in them, prevents all penſive reflexions. Grief and delight are not at the ſame time reconcileable in the ſame ſubject. Men by a naturall temperament are diſpoſed to put the moſt favourable conſtruction upon their own actions. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof bearing a direct oppoſition to this inclination, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally entertained with diſtaſt. Upon this account he which is concerned, in ſtead of being meliorated by it, is under ſtrong temptations from his vindicative appetite to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and contrive revenge. Therefore if he which gave it, be not fenced with iron, and fortified with an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable innocence, the ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> will be ſure to invade him, and draw his arrows ſo deep, as not onely to wound him, but likewiſe through his ſides that Sacred Function which he hath taken upon him.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſchiefs coming to the Church by a bad life, the Governours are endued with an Authority to inquire as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Commiſſion and Doctrine, ſo likewiſe into the lives
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51243:33"/>of thoſe who are the objects of their Inſpection; that by their pious admonitions and paternall cenſures, they may regulate and amend what is enormous. The not exerting this power was the ſin of <hi>Eli</hi> the High Prieſt. When <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> by their licentious deportment had made themſelves vile, or as it is in the Hebrew accurſed, that is liable to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or curſe which uſe to paſs upon thoſe who were excommunicated, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.25. he as the High Prieſt did neglect to diſcharge his duty, and reſtrain them from coming to the publick Congregation. His private correption recorded, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23. is ſo full and emphaticall, that no defect diſcovers it ſelf to the moſt piercing and criticall Eye.</p>
            <p>This is the Power which S. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed in delivering the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> to Satan. The Greek Interpreters believe that he was one of the Teachers of that Church. He being a leader in the Schiſm, the adverſe Party was puffed up at his fall, and highly pleaſed with the diſgrace which his miſcarriage had branded his own Party with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The giving Rules for the preſerving of Order and Decency. There are no heats more quick and pernicious to the Church than thoſe which derive their originall from differences about Order and the circumſtances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Adiaphorous and leſſer matters like ſmaller wood will kindle ſooner than that which is more ſubſtantiall. It is well known, how violent the conteſt was betwixt the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches about a circumſtance of time. The vulgar uſually are moſt liberall in the expence of their zeal about what is circumſtantiall. The fundamentall part of Religion lies deeper and more concealed from their obſervation.</p>
            <p>Reaſon like a needle touched with the Magnet hath ſuch a Poſition, that its aſpect naturally is towards thoſe Principles which are ſelf-evident, and may be ſtiled the poles of Truth: and therefore ſo long as it is converſant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51243:33"/>about Propoſitions which have not an immediate connexion with them, it is apt to tremble and vary, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ſame way in all. This variety in the thoughts of men when diſcloſed, produceth a diſlike betwixt them. He who diſſents from another, declares that he believes himſelf to be wiſer then he in that particular, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence attributes to him ſome degree of Folly, with which imputation none are well pleaſed. This diſlike being heated with paſſionate reflexions is preſently ſublimated, and boiled up into an enmity. An enmity upon the firſt occaſion will break out, and diſcloſe it ſelf in an open combuſtion. So that the Church muſt neceſſarily periſh, if ſhe be denied the priviledge which is eſſentiall to all Communities, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Power to preſerve her ſelf, and extinguiſh her flames by a prudent determination. The holy Scripture delivers the Eſſentials of Religion in particular Precepts, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials and matters of Order in generall. The Churches determination upon ſome particulars in a congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and conformity to the generall Command, is no additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Rule, but an extraction from it of what before was virtually contained in it. He makes no addition to a Maſs of gold, who beats it out into ſeverall pieces.</p>
            <p>Neither is it prejudiciall to any liberty which thoſe who embrace the Doctrine of Chriſt are bound to maintain. The reſtraint is laid onely upon the outward Man, who is limited in reſpect of uſe, and not upon the Judgement which is the proper ſeat of Liberty.</p>
            <p>Neither is our Duty to comply with it leſſened by any obligation to comport with the infirmity of the Weak. It is uſually ſaid, that the Load-ſtone will not draw in the preſence of a Diamond. When theſe two injunctions to obey Authority, and to yeeld to the weak, meet together, and both cannot be obſerved, the laſt which is certainly the leſs, muſt loſe its Energy, and according to the true intent of the Legiſlator, give place to the greater. Thoſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51243:34"/>who make the objection, uſually conceive, that Governours through weakneſs, &amp; want of inſight into their Duty, make ſuch determinations: and then if there be ſo much Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty left as to believe they are Chriſtians, the weak will be offended as well by our not obeying, as by obeying. We ſtanding equally poiſed betwixt both, are undoubtedly bound to prefer our weak Brother, who hath Authority on his ſide, before him who hath none.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The cenſuring thoſe who neglect the Order which is agreed upon. The ſmalneſs of the thing commanded is no juſt Plea againſt the equity of a Cenſure in caſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. The publick intereſt being more valuable then any private concern; and the Authority of Governours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the genuine means conducing to its ſupport, the juſtice of a penalty is not to be eſtimated ſolely by the intrinſick nature of the crime, but by the malevolent aſpect it hath upon theſe two, and the degrees of inconvenience and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which they receive from it. A leſſer crime in ſome circumſtances may be more detrimentall and leſs agreeable to the intereſt of the Community than a greater in other. And the leſs the thing is which is commanded and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, the greater is the contempt of that Authority which impoſeth it. He which will break with another for a ſmall matter, declares that his reſpects to him are not of the firſt magnitude.</p>
            <p>As the Authority of a Governour is more ſignally owned by a conformity to his poſitive Commands, which have their ſole dependence upon his will, then to his naturall, which are the dictates of univerſall Reaſon: (for in the firſt caſe it is ſingly and alone acknowledged: in the ſecond it is ſo blended with the reaſon of the thing, that it is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived to which of them the agnition is directed) ſo likewiſe the Rule of oppoſition will juſtifie this concluſion, that it is more diſowned by ſuch a diſobedience.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with the Diſeaſe, which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
